### Mouse operations

Some functions can be operated with mouse.

| Operation                                                  | Function                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Click camera 1~4 icon                                      | Change icon (\*1)           |
| Click camera 1~4 label                                     | Change label (\*2)          |

| Click ![quit](docs/img/button_quit.png) button             | Quit application            |

- (\*1) Camera label will be automatically changed according to changing camera icon.
  - The file name of the icon (excluding the extension) will be adopted.
- (\*2) Camera icon will be automatically changed according to changing camera label.
  - If {label string}.jpg/png/bmp was found under predefined folder, it will be adopted as an icon image in this priority order.
    - macOS binary: Tiny View Plus.app/Contents/ Resources/data/pilots
    - others: data/pilots
  - If no image file is found, the default icon will be adopted.
  - The aspect ratio is forced to 1:1.

### Gamepad operations

Some functions can also be operated with gamepad. Up to 4 gamepads can be used simultaneously.

| Button  | Function                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1~4     | Add lap at camera 1~4 (manual measurement) |
| 5 + 1~4 | Delete previos lap at camera 1~4           |

### QR Code for label setting

You can set the camera label by the QR Code.

![qr_screen.png](docs/img/qr_screen.png)

You can use Google Charts API to create QR Code. An example of URL is as follows.

[https://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=500x500&chl=TinyViewPlus](https://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=500x500&chl=TinyViewPlus)

It is convenient to embed the QR Code in the OSD. An example of an image for the Betaflight is as follows.

![qr_betaflight.png](docs/img/qr_betaflight.png)

\* "QR Code" is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.

### AR lap timer

You can measure the lap time by using AR marker.

![argate_single.png](docs/img/argate_single.png)
![argate_multi.png](docs/img/argate_multi.png)

Please place 8 or more markers around the gate. Also make sure that the top of the marker faces the center of the gate. Following four types of markers are supported. It does not matter if only one type is placed as shown above.

- [marker_00_main_a.png](docs/img/marker_00_main_a.png)
- [marker_01_main_b.png](docs/img/marker_01_main_b.png)
- [marker_02_main_c.png](docs/img/marker_02_main_c.png)
- [marker_03_main_d.png](docs/img/marker_03_main_d.png)

The size of the marker should be 120-150mm per side. Larger marker will be suitable for higher speed range. If marker recognition is not successful, please try increasing the size of the marker or placing them in a brighter place.

Following are gate design  prototypes.

- Normal gate : [Whole (A0)](docs/gate/MainGate_TypeA.pdf) [Part (A4)](docs/gate/MainGate_TypeA_A4.pdf)
- Gate for high speed : [Whore (A0)](docs/gate/MainGate_TypeC.pdf) [Part (A3)](docs/gate/MainGate_TypeC_A3.pdf)
- [Others](docs/gate)

Lap time will be measured only during the race. After detecting two or more correctly oriented markers simultaneously, when the marker disappears from the screen, lap time will be confirmed. However, if the direction of the last displayed marker is incorrect, the measurement will be canceled.

Depending on the environment, recognition processing of markers might be heavy. In that case, please disable the function.

### Combination of automatic and manual measurement

When automatic and manual measurement are used together, the one with earlier timing will be adopted and recorded. The one with later timing will be rejected and not be recorded.

However, if the interval between the two is equal to or greater than the minimum lap time setting, it will be considered as individual laps, both will be adopted and will be recorded.
